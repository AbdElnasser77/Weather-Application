- [WeatherAPI](https://www.weatherapi.com/) - WeatherAPI
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - Bootstrap

### What I learned

Practiced more of bootstrap and made it responsive using the bootstrap grid
definitely need more practice and recape bootstrap 
i am better at js and i think i am generally good at it but i always keep thinking of better and cleaner code which is sometimes frustrating

Learnt AJAX and APIs and the API Base URL and passing parameters to it

### Continued development

- Console keeps on outputing errors when entering a location due to onInput event and passing the value to the API URL directly
maybe i will look into it and refactor the code to make it cleaner
- geolocation API for displaying the Weather based on the location of the user when first loading up the APP
